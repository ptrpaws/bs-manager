# Reporting Security Issues

If you discover a security issue in BSManager, please report it by sending an
email to [contact@bsmanager.io](mailto:contact@bsmanager.io).

This will allow us to assess the risk, and make a fix available before we add a
bug report to the GitHub repository.

Thanks for helping make BSManager safe for everyone.
